URL: https://hkm-puzzle-game.web.app

## Description and Purpose of the Game

The game is a prototype of an "escape room"-type of problem solving game, where one level is one different puzzle. The player must beat every puzzle in order to escape (win) the game. The games are pretty simple, they contain dragging, clicking and riddle-solving.

## Instructions

The idea of the game is that the player don't get any information beforehand, but the sake of this course I'll write below what is supposed to happen in each level, but I courage you to first go in blind and then come back and see the instructions if you were not able to beat the levels.

### Opening the Game

When the player navigates to the game site, there is a text "Are you ready to escape the game?" and a "Yes!" button. When a player clicks the button, they are forwarded to a level selection screen. The levels are "Riddles", "Ball Smack" and "Sorting". After each level there is a text saying whether the level is completed or not. The levels the player has completed are saved.

### Riddles

In this level you have to answer correctly to three riddles. Every riddle has three answer options the player can choose. Whether the player answers correctly to each riddle, the level is completed. Otherwise they must try again.

### Ball Smack

The idea of this level is to smack balls by clicking them and collect characters that form a word that lets player clear the level. The word will be formed to the top left corner of the screen. On the top right corner of the screen there are player's health. The health is reduced every time a ball falls of the screen. If the health drops to zero before the whole word is formed, the player must start the level again.

### Sorting

In this level the task is to sort the circles and squares to the correct frames. The frames have counters that are incremented when a correct shape is dragged inside the frame. The level is cleared when all of the shapes are gone. There is no real way to lose this level.

### End of the Game

After each level there is a screen with either congratulations or a request to try again with a button that leads either to level selection or final screen, depending on if all of the levels have been beaten. The final screen has "Play again" -button. When a player clicks that button, completed levels are cleared and the game "starts over".
